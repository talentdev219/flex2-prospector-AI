      "I hope this email finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I'm reaching out from [Company Name], a leading provider of rent payment solutions. I came across your property management company, [Company Name], and noticed that you haven't yet adopted our Flex payment system. I'd like to introduce you to the numerous benefits of Flex and explore if it's a good fit for your residents.\n",

We look forward to welcoming you to the Flex Family! \\n\\nI've attached a one-pager with some FAQs and outlined Flex (in a nutshell) below for your review and to share with the team:\\n\\n1. Flex pays rent on behalf of your residents, in full, at the 1st of every month\\n2. Residents pay Flex back on a schedule that works best for them\\n3. Flex offers a simple, flat-fee model of $19.99/month to residents (no interest, no hidden fees)\\n4. Residents can sign-up in minutes via the Flex app or mobile site (instant approval) ~ on-time payments will build your resident's credit\\n5. Flex is built to be a financial amenity to your residents to provide them financial freedom, reduce stress, and improve their overall financial health (while getting you rent on time)\\n\\nFlex has no contract and is at no cost to the landlord. I'm confident this is an invaluable financial resource for your team and your residents.\\n\\nIn addition, I've attached the property list needed to get started on our program. Once this document is filled out and returned, we can get AMC Delancey in the queue (implementation date to be determined by you).\\n\\nThanks again Patrick, we look forward to working with your team. \\n\\nTalk soon!\",\n",
